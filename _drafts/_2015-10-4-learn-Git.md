title: Learn Git
---

Far too many people (including myself) graduate university with a CS degree without realling learning [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Sure you might be able to use the basic commands to get by when working on a project but you dont really understand what is going on behind the scenes. The GitHub client having a magic sync button does not help the matter at all.

It is 2015, [Git has won](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=git%2C%20svn&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT-11) , so if you are planning on having a successful career as a software developer you are going to need to properly learn Git.
