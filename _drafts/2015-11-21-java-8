title: Java 8
---

I have been using Java 8 at work for around 6 months now and the [streams api](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#package.description)
is really excellent. 




The biggest impact is that it has changed how I think about solving problems. I now think about data processeing in terms of transformations rather than
instructions, map .


I didnt have any experience with Functional Programming

I didnt have that much experience using anonymous functions

If you are seeing this then I actully got around to hosting a blog and will probably be adding some actual content soon.
