Hello I am Gene Taylor, a software developer from Sydney.
I work for [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/), which is a pretty sweet place to work. Currently I am on the team responsible for integrating JIRA with development tools like Bitbucket.

Before moving to Sydney I studied at the University of Otago in [Dunedin](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Dunedin,+New+Zealand/@-41.1155622,166.2844226,5.79z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xa82be4e00f5f513d:0x500ef8684799941), New Zealand, obtaining a Bachelor of Arts and Postgraduate diploma in Philosophy and a Diploma for Graduates in Computer Science.
