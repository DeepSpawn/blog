Hello I am Gene Taylor, a software developer living in Sydney. I first got into programming by hacking together games on the [Casio fx-9750G](http://www.casio-intl.com/asia-mea/en/calc/pastmodels/product_list?m_no=258) using Casio BASIC. These day I use a lot less GOTOs and a lot more Java and Javascript. I have done some work in Microsoft land with C# and have build a small site using node.js and express. At the moment I am still enjoying the move to Java 8, lambdas are a lot fun.

I started my Proessional Career at the start of 2015, relocating from New Zealand to Australia to start working for the wonderful people at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/). I currently work on the team resposible for integrating JIRA with Developement tools.

Having relatively recently started in the industry I have found that well written blogpposts are a goldmine of useful information for a long while after they are written. This is my attempt to positively give something back to the wider developer community. It is mostly observations and notes of things I have picked up thus far as a journeyman software developer.

This is my personal blog and all views expressed here belong to me alone and not those of my employer. So if/when I say something inaccurate or stupid it rests solely on my shoulders.
